      <h1>Who am I? Hmm...</h1>
      <p>
        Hello fellow viewer, I am Debaditya Bhattacharjee, a computer science and web development enthusiast. My habit and inclination towards playing video games from a young age ignited the passion of learning & understanding about the underlying mechanisms of the computer world. As I grew older, my passion for computer & other electronic devices gradually increased.
      </p>
      <p>
        I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from a reputed college in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. During the three-year long degree, I discovered many domains of the IT field. I was fascinated by programming languages from a young age and getting to practice and study it as a full time student was one of the best feelings.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was eager to learn about cybersecurity, hacking, web-dev, databases and languages that can help me build games. Amongst these, web-dev seemed to be a creative domain. I got an internship as a Cybersecurity intern at a Kolkata based EdTech startup and later switched to web-dev in the same company. During the six month long internship I learnt many new skills and got to know about several vulnerablities and ways that are used to exploit the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        The journey I have embarked upon is far from over. There is a lot left to learn and discover. And here is where you get to know what I have learnt, built & experienced...

            <h2><u>Stop Watch Application</u></h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
              This stopwatch web application features a visually appealing design with a timer displayed in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. It includes four control buttons: <b><i>Start</i></b>, which initiates the timer and changes to <b><i>Pause</i></b>; Pause, which halts the timer and reverts to Start; <b><i>Reset</i></b>, which sets the timer back to <b>00:00:00</b>; and <b><i>Lap Timer</i></b>, which records lap times, displaying the lap number, lap time, and total elapsed time. The layout is responsive, ensuring usability on different screen sizes.

              "Weatherly" provides a user-friendly interface to check the weather. It features a responsive design with controls for toggling between light and dark modes, entering a location for weather information, and displaying current weather conditions and a 7-day forecast. The layout includes buttons for clear input and fetching weather data, along with icons for a sun, moon, search, and close. The dark mode changes the background color and text to improve visibility. The design aims for simplicity and functionality, enhancing the user experience.

            <h2><u>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</u></h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
              This tic-tac-toe project is a simple game where two players, either human or AI, take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The game starts with the "Start Game" button, allowing players to choose between playing against another player or an AI opponent. The "Player 2" button enables a two-player game, while the "Play against AI" button initiates a game against the AI. The game includes a timer that allows each player three seconds to make a move. If a player fails to make a move within the time limit, the opposing player wins. The game board displays the current state of the game, and players can reset the board or play again after a win or draw.

            <p style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
              From this project, I got an idea about how as a business or data analyst we work on real-time data to take any data-driven decision. One thing I infer about this project is the dataset provided was very limited and small in respect of Rows and columns, But still, it was a very good experience working on such kind of project. It helped me a lot to understand the analysis process well, and to provide insights for the best decision possible.

            <p style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
              This project is a website featuring a navigation menu with links to different pages. It includes a fixed navigation bar that changes its background color when scrolled. The navigation links have background images that change when hovered over, adding a visual effect. The website is responsive, with the navigation menu adapting to smaller screens by becoming a side navigation bar. The content layout adjusts accordingly, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices. The use of custom fonts and scrollbars enhances the overall design and usability of the website.
